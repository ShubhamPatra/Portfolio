    about: `I'm Shubham Patra, a final-year B.Tech student in Computer Science & Information Technology at ITER, SOA University, with a strong focus on full-stack web development and building systems that solve real problems.

I enjoy turning ideas into scalable, production-ready applications—from real-time collaborative tools to AI-powered assistants like Nyx. I care more about logic than layout and prefer simplicity over overengineering.

Recently, I completed a Full Stack Developer Internship at Kurators (Aug–Dec 2025), where I worked on live production features, collaborated with cross-functional teams, and followed Agile development workflows. The experience helped me understand how real-world systems are built, optimized, and maintained at scale.

I believe in shipping fast, learning by doing, and writing code that's easy to read and maintain. Clean architecture, meaningful variable names, and thoughtful problem-solving guide everything I build.`
